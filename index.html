    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: 10 January 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Standard Online Shop</strong>
        handles user information. The app provides easy access to our official online store powered
        by the Vyapar platform.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Standard Online Shop does not collect, store, or process any personal user data.</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>No registration is required</li>
        <li>No special permissions are requested</li>
        <li>No personal or device data is collected</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>WebView & Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The app loads our official online store using a WebView. All product browsing,
        ordering, and payment processing are handled entirely by the Vyapar platform.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any information you provide on the website is governed by Vyapar’s own
        Privacy Policy and Terms. We do not have access to or control over that data.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
        The app itself does not use cookies. However, the website displayed inside the app
        may use cookies as part of its normal operation. This behavior is controlled by
        the website provider (Vyapar).
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Since the app does not collect or store personal information, no user data is stored
        on our servers. Website interactions occur over secure HTTPS connections.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        This app is not specifically directed toward children under the age of 13 and does not
        knowingly collect any personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected
        on this page with an updated revision date.
    </p>
